## Short Bio

After finishing my PhD in Mathematics with a focus on the combinatorics of the Grassmannian, I took an interest in data engineering and data science. To kickstart my career path in that direction, I completed an immersive course in Data Engineering provided by AICore.

During the course in Data Engineering, I finished the following projects:

- [Hangman](https://github.com/JCR94/hangman): A simple game of Hangman played in the terminal. In this project, I refreshed my Python skills and learned how to use Git and GitHub.
- [Multinational Retail Data Centralisation](https://github.com/JCR94/multinational-retail-data-centralisation): We extract data from multiple sources, clean them, and store them in a relation database. In this project, I learned how to work with Pandas dataframes, and how to work with relational databases and SQL.
- [Pinterest Data Pipeline](https://github.com/JCR94/pinterest-data-pipeline13): A data pipeline for Pinterest data. In this project, we learned how to use a variety of cloud technologies, in particular AWS and DataBricks, and how to work with PySpark DataFrames.

I'm currently further exploring the world of Data Engineering and improving my skills as I go along with it. My goal is to move towards Data Science at a later stage. I also take an interest in software development.
