### Hi! I'm Joel. ðŸ‘‹

## About me

```python
joel_costa = {
    'name': 'Joel Costa',
    'location': 'Leeds, UK',
    'computer_languages': ['Python','C#','Java'],
    'human_languages': ['English','Portuguese','German','French','Luxembourgish'],
    'interests': ['Mathematics','Data Science','Languages','Video Games','Card Games']
}
```
I have a PhD in Mathematics, with a focus on the combinatorics of the Grassmannian. I'm now learning about data science. I am interested in anything that has a combinatorial aspect to it, mathematics, coding, and stubbornly crafting ridiculous combinations of moves in video games and card games.
